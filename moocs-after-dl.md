## Your next deep learning MOOC

Since this is the final course of the specialization, I know a lot of your will be looking for what to do next. Obviously, you could work on new models of your own or tackle one of the deep learning books. But if you’re thinking of taking another MOOC course, here are a bunch of suggestions. This isn’t completely exhaustive, but it’s most of the MOOCs pertaining to deep learning.

I’ll update as necessary. Please post below if you have corrections or suggestions.

I believe all of these courses are free (or free to audit, at least), except where noted. They aren’t in any particular order, though Coursera courses are mostly at the top and non-MOOC university courses are at the bottom.

If you haven’t taken it yet:

* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng (Stanford/Coursera), uses Octave
An oldie but goodie, that you should now be well-prepared for:

* [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) by Geoff Hinton (Toronto/Coursera), uses Octave (Python versions of the assignments are also available.)

If you want to dive into the math of ML/DL, there’s a new [Mathematics of Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) Specialization, from UCL on Coursera. Programming assignments use Python. The teaching and production values are excellent! Courses include:

1. [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning) -- dot products, determinants, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, etc.
2. [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Multivariate Calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning) -- differentiation, Jacobians, Hessians, backprop, Taylor series, gradient descent, etc.
3. [Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA](https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning) -- more of the above, leading up to PCA

Want more machine learning? UW’s [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) on Coursera covers the basics, using Python:

1. [Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)
2. [Machine Learning: Regression](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression)
3. [Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification)
4. [Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval)

Ready for a machine learning challenge? Try HSE’s [Advanced Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) on Coursera. Programming assignments are in Python (so far). The courses are significantly more advanced that in the average MOOC. Projects can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/hse-aml/). The first four courses are launched. Courses include:

1. [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) -- includes GANs and linking CNNs to RNNs
2. [How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science) -- covers lots of practical EDA, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization
3. [Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning) -- EM, LDA, MCMC, VAEs, etc.
4. [Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) -- includes deeper looks at DL topics introduced in Sequence Models, as well as coverage of classical NLP approaches
5. [Practical Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl) -- value/policy iteration, MDPS, Q-learning, DQNs, etc.
6. [Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-in-computer-vision) -- pre-DL computer vision methods (e.g. Gaussian filters & Canny edge detectors) and CNNs applied to object detection, tracking (in video), and image segmentation/synthesis (using style transfer & GANs)
7. [Addressing Large Hadron Collider Challenges by Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hadron-collider-machine-learning) (expected May 2018)

If you’re interested in getting a little closer to the hardware used in deep learning, there are some good courses that introduce programming for specific architectures. All require proficiency in C and are relatively advanced:

1. [Fundamentals of Parallelism on Intel Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallelism-ia) - covers vectorization, OpenMP, MPI, etc. on Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing with AVX-512), from Intel/Colfax Research/Coursera
2. [Introduction to Parallel Programming](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344) - CUDA programming on Nvidia GPUs from Nvidia/Udacity, covering things like parallel scatter/gather and manually implemented kernels
3. [Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+C-AC-01+V1/about)
4. [Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python](https://nvidia.qwiklab.com/quests/18)

Other classes on Coursera:

1. [Applied AI with DeepLearning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai) -- a fast-paced course, covering the basics (MLP, CNNs, RNNs, embeddings), as well as more advanced topics (autoencoders, time series forecasting, anomaly detection) and different frameworks (TF, Keras, PyTorch, DeepLearning4J, SystemML) on the IBM Data Science Experience (DSX)
2. [An Introduction to Practical Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-practical-deep-learning) -- a tour of deep learning techniques (feedforward, CNN, & RNN mostly) using the Intel Nervana Neon framework, from Intel/Coursera (Python is used in the optional labs.)

Microsoft has a series of deep learning courses on [Microsoft Cloud Society](https://cloudsociety.learning.microsoft.com/). They use CNTK (on top of Python):

1. [Deep Learning Explained](https://cloudsociety.learning.microsoft.com/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT236x+2018_T1/about) -- the basics (MLP, CNN, & RNN), this time with CNTK and a focus on parameter counting
2. [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://cloudsociety.learning.microsoft.com/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV288x+2018_T1/about) -- content mostly complementary to Sequence Models, since it focuses on Deep Semantic Similarity Models
3. [Reinforcement Learning Explained](https://cloudsociety.learning.microsoft.com/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT257x+2018_T1/about) -- MDPs, DQNs, etc.

IBM's [CognitiveClass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/) (formerly called Big Data University; based on OpenEdX) has a trio of brief and relatively basic courses that explore a wide variety of models & frameworks and award free certificates & [badge](https://cognitiveclass.ai/badges/deep-learning/):

1. [Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/introduction-deep-learning/) -- based on the [DeepLearning.TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OeZkIwhzfv-_Cb7fCikLQ/videos?sort=da&view=0&flow=grid) YouTube series

Fast.ai/USF has its very popular Deep Learning for Coders series. The instructors, Jeremy Howard & Rachel Thomas, take the reverse approach compared to most courses, starting with full working models and working backwards to examine how they function. The older version of the courses uses Python with TensorFlow & Keras. The new version uses PyTorch. As of February 2018, only the first course has been updated to PyTorch.

1. [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/)
2. [Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html)

Kadenze has a 3-course series called [Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.kadenze.com/programs/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow). Its cost is $500 + $20/month. The focus is less on prediction-type tasks and more on generating art, text, & audio.

Udacity has its [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). Its cost is $599. I don’t know much about this, other than that Ian Goodfellow, inventor of GANs, is one of the instructors.

And finally, here are some university courses you might find helpful. I’m limiting this to courses that offer lecture videos. Some include assignments that you can work through.
